Form Handling in React: Controlled Components & Formik

This project demonstrates two approaches to handling forms in React:

1 -Controlled Components — Manual state management using `useState`.
2- Formik Integration — Advanced form handling with built-in validation using Formik and Yup.

The form simulates a user registration process with fields for **username**, **email**, and **password**.
